#RemoteNestDetection

R script developed to detect nesting attempts using GPS and ODBA data.

1. The script presented in this repository is associated with a paper currently submitted for publication. A reference to the paper explaining the script will be provided after publication.

2. This script uses the R package suntools (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/suntools/index.html) to estimate sunrise and sunset times (function sunriset), as the maptools package~(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools/index.html) was deprecated in October 2023.

3. Test files for male and female sandgrouses are provided, as well as an example of the dictionary used to add information for each individual. We also include a folder with expected results for each step of the script.

4. Coordinates in the test files were intentionally modified since both sandgrouse are sensitive to disturbances, and original coordinates were associated with nest sites.
